Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances large language models by incorporating external knowledge sources. 

The RAG pipeline typically consists of three main components:
1. Data Ingestion: Collecting and processing data from various sources
2. Vector Storage: Converting documents into embeddings and storing them in a vector database
3. Retrieval and Generation: Finding relevant context and generating responses based on that context

RAG systems are particularly useful when you need to provide accurate, up-to-date information that may not be in the model's training data. They combine the generative capabilities of LLMs with the precision of information retrieval systems.

The key advantage of RAG is that it allows models to access and cite specific sources, making responses more trustworthy and verifiable.
